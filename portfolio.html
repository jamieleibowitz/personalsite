                <p class="proj-descript">Vibes develops a platform for their customers to be able to organize and send out promotions, offers, and loyalty cards via SMS, MMS, 3rd-party app push notifications, and Mobile Wallet. As a software engineer on the Mobile Wallet team, I maintained the part of the platform responsible for integrating with the Apple Wallet and Google Pay apps, as well as the generation of mobile-friendly web pages leading to offers and loyalty cards and many other uses besides. Various passes and pages are organized into "Campaigns" which collect editable templates for said passes and pages and allow for integration with the SMS/MMS parts of the platform. These features are available through a web UI interface and a multitude of API capabilities. <br>
                Outcome: I have done work on nearly every part of the suite of Ruby on Rails apps that make up the Mobile Wallet component of the platform, from infrastructure pieces like database work and CI/CD pipelines to the UI seen in the broswer, which uses a combination of plain javascript, Backbone.js, jQuery, and React. This work has included features such as Event-Triggered Notifications, campaign-level passholder data downloads, and an API for creating and updating pass templates as well as the integration of these APIs into our UI. I have also helped to maintain, support, and deploy these applications, as much of the original code was developed 10 years ago and has been kept up to date ever since.

                <p class="proj-descript"><a href="https://weregazelle.itch.io/armour-astir">Armour Astir</a> is an independent tabletop role-playing game inspired by anime shows like Gundam and Vision of Escaflowne. It uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powered_by_the_Apocalypse">Powered by the Apocalypse</a> rule framework as its basis. The intent of this project was to use <a href="https://roll20.net/">Roll20's</a> powerful open-source integration capabilities for creating and playing tabletop role-playing games online in order to assist with running a game of Armour Astir for a group of friends. Specifically, Roll20 allows users with premium accounts to upload custom templates for character sheets in their games. <br>
                Outcome: The character sheet is up and running! If you want to see my fork of the project with the character sheet, <a href="https://github.com/jamieleibowitz/roll20-character-sheets/compare/master...jamieleibowitz:armour-astir-sheet">look no further!</a> The code was based on another character sheet in the main repository for a game called Blades in the Dark. From this, I was able to create a character sheet that included features such as clickable project clocks, an expanding/collapsing list of moves a player can take along with the ability to automatically roll dice by clicking on a move and add in custom moves, and a separate section specifically for the player's mech. My character sheet also allows you to toggle between to "flavors" of the game, as during its initial development the game had a "high fantasy" setting and a "hard sci-fi" setting. One of the biggest challenges I overcame with this project was the extremely limited javascript capabilities within Roll20 character sheets (for good reason! Letting users execute whatever javascript they want on your site is extremely dangerous). Where I would by default go to javascript for things like toggleable buttons and expanding/collapsing editable lists, the limits here meant that I was doing the same things except using fancy conditional CSS to hide and display elements of the character sheet rather than generating new elements on the fly.</p></li>

                <p class="proj-descript">This project combines two passions of mine: tech and music. I've produced music for most of my teen and adult life, but I've always felt unsatisfied with my mixing and mastering skills when I put my songs alongside professionally produced ones. This project was intended to help with that by allowing me to plot my music's EQ profile on the same graph as my reference tracks so that I could more closely approach their sound by adjusting my song to more closely match the other's EQ plot.<br>
                Outcome: This program achieved its purpose of helping me with my music, as well as being a solid demonstration of my ability to code in Python. I gained experience using several well-known modules, such as scipy, numpy, matplotlib, and tkinter. It also required some mathematical knowledge to understand how Fourier Transforms and specifically Fast Fourier Transform functions work, as well as some problem-solving as running a single fft call on large quantities of data in python causes memory errors. The solution was to fourier transform small chunks of the song and then average them to get the overall result. <a target="blank" href="https://github.com/jamieleibowitz/eqanalyzer">Check out the code for my EQ Analyzer on Github!</a> Also, <a target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/experimentalsoundlab/the-jacobs-ladder">check out my latest track on Soundcloud!</a></p></li>

I also aimed to provide myself with a way to put all of my various online presences in one place for the purposes of seeking employment and also showing off things that I've done that are unrelated to tech or engineering. <br>
                Outcome: A website that showcases my ability to create a website and acts as a central repository for projects I'd like to share with potential employers and ways to contact me.

                <p class="proj-descript">During the summer of 2013, I worked with Douglas Downey and several of his grad students on a program for the visualization of large amounts of data. When I joined, the project had already yielded a published paper, and Professor Downey wanted me to help to expand the types of data visualizations Atlasify could display. <br>
                Outcome: This was my first experience with SQL Databases, as that was where Atlasify drew its data from most directly. I was primarily writing queries for the database to test the functions of the app in new situations. If you'd like to see the paper that was published, here's a link that gives an <a target="blank" href="https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~bhecht/publications/bhecht_sigir2012_ExpSpatialization_SRplusE.pdf">overview of the Atlasify project.</a></p></li>

                <p class="proj-descript">This project had two purposes. The first was to refresh myself on C++ coding for a position I was applying for at the time. The second was that in a DnD game I've been playing with my friends, I am playing a druid and was getting annoyed at trying to figure out what I could and couldn't turn into, what would be the reason to pick a specific animal to turn into, and so on. So, I made a helper program! <br>
                Outcome: I relearned C++ after about six years of not using it at all, created a program that takes in druid level and circle and generates a list of all possible beast shapes to take, what CR they have, Armor Class, HP, and movement speeds. If you're interested in the code or trying this utility out for yourself, here's a <a target="blank" href="https://github.com/jamieleibowitz/beastshape">link to the Beast Shape code on Github!</a></p></li>

                <p class="proj-descript">My role at Fermilab was primarily that of a junior level Mechanical Engineer, but occasionally I worked on projects that required custom coding to simplify and present large quantities of data. This project analyzed data from a surface scan of a Tungsten-Rhenium wire which broke in the accelerator in order to determine the cause of failure and develop future best practices for preparing and installing these wires. The data from the laser spectrometer was output in a csv file, which I then used MATLAB to filter and analyze. <br>
                Outcome: It was determined that the cause of failure was radiation causing the material to fracture prematurely, and along with the tension the wire was required to maintain, it snapped much sooner than expected. These results were published in a report on Fermilab's DocDB. I got some more experience analyzing data and developed my own custom filtering program for the scans in MATLAB, and had it output the surface roughness in terms of average displacement from centerline, standard deviations, and RMS method. After developing my code, we discovered that the laser spectrometer's host program which made the csvs in the first place also had functions to do the same thing I had coded. While it is never a good thing to reinvent the wheel, I was proud to find that my code returned the same results as the professionally made program.</p>

                <p class="proj-descript">This project involved using a pre-made numerical analysis program simulating the inside of a device another engineer had designed in CAD to determine what the air pressure inside the device would be at specific points in the chamber. After using the program, I was asked to check the program's numbers using more direct computation methods. <br>
                Outcome: Using a Monte-Carlo analysis program, I found that the amount of surface area inside the device would lead to an unacceptably high pressure for the required vacuum level. My own "hand-checking" calculations using MATLAB involved the numerical solving of differential equations and some interesting applications of fluid dynamics. The project was never completed due to lack of funding, unfortunately.</p></li>

                <p class="proj-descript">A live video feed system for high altitude balloons. This project had two major parts. First, the actual transmitter and receiver: the other interns and I connected a video transmitter to a GoPro camera attached to the balloon. The transmissions were received by a Yagi directional antenna, connected directly to a computer monitor to display the incoming data. <br>
                Next, the automated antenna pointing system. This system used a custom-built frame operated by two servo motors acting to create a system of spherical coordinates - one servo for the "theta" angle and one for "phi". The servos were controlled by an Arduino microcontroller which received data from the balloon regarding GPS coordinates (received by a Raspberry Pi), altitude, and signal strength. Using these three types of data, the arduino effectively calculated the approximate position of the balloon in the sky relative to the location of the antenna and directed the servos to point the Yagi antenna at the balloon, with a correction algorithm to obtain maximum signal strength. <br>
                Outcome: Tons of experience using maker technologies, RF equipment, microcontroller programming, data analysis, and mechanical design.</p></li>
