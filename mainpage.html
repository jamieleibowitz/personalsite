        <p>Hello! My name is Jamie, and my pronouns are she/her or they/them. I graduated in 2017 from Northwestern with a degree in Mechanical Engineering. As an Engineering student, I worked with places such as the Adler Planetarium, Schmoop, and Fermi National Laboratory. </br></br>

        I am currently in the market for web developer jobs as well as positions that utilize my knowledge of maker technologies like 3d printing and Raspberry Pi. Either is good with me! </br></br>
            
        In my spare time, I enjoy making electronic video gamey music, consuming sci fi and fantasy works in all their various formats, and participating in larps and tabletop roleplaying games. </p>
    </body>
